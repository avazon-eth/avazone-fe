# Blockchain DApp Development Project

## Overview

Welcome to our groundbreaking decentralized application (DApp), a pioneering project crafted for the forefront of blockchain innovation. This application is not just a participant in a blockchain competition; it is a testament to the transformative power of blockchain technology. Our DApp is designed to revolutionize the way digital assets and licenses are managed, offering a platform that is not only secure and transparent but also remarkably efficient.

## Features

- **License Management**: Our application empowers users with the ability to seamlessly select and manage a diverse array of licenses for their digital assets. This feature ensures that users maintain full control over their intellectual property, safeguarding their creations in the digital realm.
